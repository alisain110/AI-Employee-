# LinkedIn Sales Strategy
1. **Tone**: Professional, helpful, and slightly witty.
2. **Hook**: Start with a strong first line to stop the scroll.
3. **Value**: Share one insight about how AI can save time for business owners.
4. **Call to Action**: Ask people to comment "AI" to learn more.
5. **Safety**: NEVER post directly. Always save to `03_Approved/` first.
