# Example Ralph Mode Task

## Configuration
mode: ralph

## Task Description
This is an example task that will trigger Ralph Wiggum mode in the orchestrator. The mode: ralph configuration at the top of this file will cause the orchestrator to run in iterative mode rather than single-pass mode.

## Objective
Research and compile a comprehensive report about the latest advancements in AI technology, including:

1. Current trends in large language models
2. Recent developments in computer vision
3. New breakthroughs in reinforcement learning
4. Ethical considerations in AI development
5. Future predictions for AI in business

## Instructions
- Start by researching current LLM architectures
- Then look into recent computer vision papers
- Continue with reinforcement learning developments
- Summarize ethical considerations
- Provide business recommendations based on findings

## Expected Output
A detailed report with sections for each of the above topics, including sources and citations.

## Notes
This task requires multiple steps and iterative research, making it perfect for Ralph mode. The orchestrator will loop through different tools and approaches until the task is complete.
